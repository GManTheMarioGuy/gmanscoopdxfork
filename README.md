# gmanscoopdxfork
GMan's fork of [sm64coopdx](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx)

This fork lets you play with up to 64 people instead of 16!

This is not a competitor to sm64coopdx, this is simply something I work on for fun.

## How to host
To host a game, press the `Host` button on the main menu.

You will have a port field in the `Host` menu that will tell the game what port to use when you host the game.

You will need to forward a port in your router to connect to each other online.

Instructions on how to forward a port: https://www.hellotech.com/guide/for/how-to-port-forward

The default port is `7777`. The protocol to forward is `UDP`.

You can open two windows and connect to yourself by using the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

## How to join
To join a game, press the `Join` button on the main menu.

The format for joining is `IP:Port`

You'll either use `127.0.0.1` for connecting to yourself, or somebody else's IP to connect to somebody else.

Example: If your friend's IP is `127.0.0.1` and they forwarded port `7777`, to join them you would enter this in the join field: `127.0.0.1:7777`.
